# Completion of QSWAP SC functions to enable integration into qubictrade.com and other user interfaces.

**Request to CCF to approve 1 billion QUBIC to finalize the QSWAP Smart Contract**

## Proposal

## Available Options
> Option 0: No, I donÂ´t approve

> Option 1: Yes, approve 1 billion QUBIC for development


## Details
The QSWAP smart contract still lacks a few necessary functionalities to provide a good user experience (UX) for users. 
These functions are:
- Transfer of management rights
- Logging of trades

Once these functions are completed, the integration of the UI on the "qubictrade.com" exchange can also be finalized.
Other upcoming user interfaces will also benefit from these functions.


The current QSWAP-team has been inactive in the #qswap channel for weeks. Therefore, the LFG team has compiled the requirements for the missing functions and found an experienced smart contract developer to implement them. 
The development and integration costs amount to approximately **1 billion QUBIC**.

The development and deployment of the UI are carried out by the LFG team and are privately funded. They are not part of the proposal.
The platform qubictrade.com is a non-commercial initiative developed in collaboration with the community.
